<h1> Materials and Equipment:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Plants under study</li>
    <li>Black mat background (42 cm x 60 cm was used)</li>
    <li>Contrast paper sticker of known size (79 x 79 mm was used)</li>
    <li> Laboratory table with sufficient lighting</li>
    <li> Any digital camera (12 - 16 MP smartphone cameras were used)</li>
    <li> Tripod (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Procedure:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Write the plant group name on the paper sticker (just not to confuse photos)</li>
    <li>Place plants and paper sticker on black mat background as shown in the example below:</li>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashabezik/Morley/main/img/IMG_2176.JPG" width=20% height=20%>
</ol>
<h1> Important: </h1>
To achieve correct object recognition:
<ol>
    <li>the seedlings should be aligned along the seeds and consistently oriented;</li>
    <li>neighboring plants must not cross each other;</li>
    <li> The paper sticker should be placed above the sprouts.</li>
</ol>
To achieve most accurate measurements:
<ol>
    <li> all roots should be thoroughly split from each other to ensure their maximum visibility for the camera as in
        the example below:
    </li>
<!--     <img src="somepic" width=20% height=20%> -->
    <li> plants should be aligned along the seeds as in the example below:</li>
    
<!--     <img src="somepic" width=20% height=20%> -->
    <li> Optimize exposure to exclude excessively bright spots and take an image (automatic adjustmentfocusing iscan be
        recommended). Visually ensure that thean image has sufficient sharpness.
    </li>
</ol>
